# ComputerVisionSkinLesion
Skin lesions are one of the most common dermatological issues faced by people worldwide. Early 
detection and identification of these lesions are crucial for timely treatment and management. With 
the advancements in the field of machine learning, various automated techniques have been 
developed to assist in the identification and diagnosis of skin lesions. In this report, we present our 
study of using machine learning techniques with MATLAB to predict the type of skin lesions based on 
the images of the lesions.
We were provided with a file of skin lesion images and ground truth labels for the same. We 
experimented with various machine learning techniques, including feature extraction, segmentation, 
and classification. Some of the techniques worked well in identifying the lesion types, while some 
did not provide accurate results.
Our study aimed to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to accurately predict skin 
lesions, thus aiding in early detection and effective management of skin disorders. The results of our 
experiments suggest that a combination of various techniques, such as feature extraction and 
classification, can provide an accurate diagnosis of skin lesions. Overall, this study demonstrates the 
potential of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing skin disorders and highlights the need for 
further research in this area.
